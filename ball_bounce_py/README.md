## 4 variants on a bouncing ball

### ball bounce 0
Basic version of a bouncing circle. Position and velocity variables are created, conditional statements are used to invert velocity variables once an edge is hit.
### ball bounce 1
Two bouncing circles are drawn to the screen, but without object orientation, we must duplicate our position and velocity variables, as well as the conditional statements to bounce off edges.
### ball bounce 2
25 bouncing circles are drawn to the screen, utilizing object orientation to create many objects from our class definition!
### bouncing dvd logo
A silly, and satisfying variation of ball bounce 0. We load and tint the dvd logo, changing colors once the logo hits the edges of the screen
